Multiple ssh Multiple Git Account
=======

See existing keys:
    
    ls -al ~/.ssh/

2. If default id_rsa exist, you need to rename it.
> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
> mv ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work.pub

3. Create one more ssh key.
> cd ~/.ssh
> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"
> Enter file in which to save the key (/home/chitresh/.ssh/id_rsa): personal
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):      (leave blank just hit enter)
Enter same passphrase again:                     (leave blank just hit enter)

Now your key is created as
personal
personal.pub

Now we need to add ssh key
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/personal

Delete cached keys
> ssh-add -D

Check cached keys
> ssh-add -l

To manage multiple account and multiple keys make a config
> touch config
> subl -a config  (open config in editor: in my case sublime)

In config add below
#My work station account
Host github.com-id_rsa_work
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work

#My personal account
Host github.com-personal
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal



Clone your repo and Cheers
